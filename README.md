# ElectronHoleGeneration

Geant4 simulation of electron-hole pair generation in materials. 3 materials are allowed: Si, SiC and C.

The mean energies of electron-hole pair generation for the materials were taken from:

* Si: doi: 10.3390/s18072289
* SiC: doi: 10.3390/s18072289
* C: https://doi.org/10.1002/pssa.201600195
